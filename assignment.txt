You’re now in Stage 1.

Using ChatGPT’s API, create a voice bot that can respond to the following questions as YOU would respond to them.

Here’s an example of questions, NOT an exhaustive list of questions that we will test your bot with.

What should we know about your life story in a few sentences?
What’s your #1 superpower?
What are the top 3 areas you’d like to grow in?
What misconception do your coworkers have about you?
How do you push your boundaries and limits?

Submission Guidelines
Provide a URL of your submission 48 hours of this message. Your submission will be a web app where the chat bot is deployed.

Important: Your submission must be universally user-friendly, even for non-technical users. Please ensure:
✅ A web app or an interactive demo that allows anyone to easily test your voicebot
✅ A setup that is simple and does not require coding knowledge or complex installations.
